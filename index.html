The story of development is about his childhood. When Linus was 12 years old, he used to help his grandfather with typing calculation programs to computer from papers.As time pass by,  he started to learn how to use computers and how to code. Programing at that age was his entertaintment. Sometimes children not only play with toys, they would like to know how it works and examine it detailed. Linus was  that kind of child. He was locking himself in a room and works with codes for hours. He never lost his interest in computer science and kept programing for fun. </p>
 
  <h3>Education</h3>
 
   <p>Linus enrolled to University of Helsinki like his parents. He took his first C programming class in 1990. C was the language which he will use to write Linux kernel. He announced it at 1991 25 August in <b>MINUX</b> newsgroup: “ Hello everybody out there using minix, I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-sytem due to practical reasons)among other things.<a href="http://www.linfo.org/linus.html">[1]</a>”</p>
